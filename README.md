# react-individual-character-input-boxes

## Why did I make this?

Henry told me to :neutral_face:

## How To Use
Two props are required with usage.
1.  amount: a number that sets the number of input boxes.
2.  handleFinalString: a callback function that handles the string output of the module.

## ToDo

Add ability to restrict letters, numbers, capitalization and symbols using regex prop

Limit component updates

Make readme way less sucky
